<h2>Overall Expectations during FLEX</h2>

<h3>What is the purpose of FLEX?  
</h3>
<p>FLEX allows all students a chance to get extra support and increase their learning. This dedicated time provides students with the flexibility to meet with teachers and staff during the school day. It gives all students time to get help with challenges, dive deeper into topics of interest, work on group projects, seek help with college and job applications, and much more.  </p>              

<h3>When is FLEX time?                                                
</h3>
<p>FLEX time is twice a week from 2:00-2:50 pm on Tuesdays (T Day) and also on Thursdays from 2:00-2:35 pm (A Day) for students who do not have a scheduled Advisory class that day. Please check the Google calendar on <a href="http://www.paly.net">paly.net</a> for the most up­-to-­date information or view the Advisory calendars which can be found <a href="https://paly.net/guidance/advisory-schedules">here</a>.</p>

<h3>How is attendance taken?</h3>

<p>Students need to check into a FLEX location by the start of the period just as any other class. Students should bring their student ID card (or a picture of their student ID card will do) so we can use the barcode to scan students into the FLEX attendance system upon arrival.  </p>

                                        

<h3>What if I don’t go to FLEX?  
</h3>
<p>Attendance for FLEX is mandatory, just like attendance for any other class. During FLEX all students are required to be in a classroom or other space used for FLEX. Cut notices will be sent home for students who do not attend and are not excused.</p>                                                

<h3>What if I have a doctor’s appointment?                        
</h3>
<p>We ask that you not schedule appointments during the school day, but we understand that sometimes this might be beyond your control. If parents wish to excuse students for medical appointments, please be sure the student signs out through the attendance office beforehand and picked­ up a “Permit to Leave Campus” slip.</p>                               

<h3>If a teacher or other staff person makes an appointment for me, do I have to go?    </h3>
<p>Yes. You must report to that staff member. You can also email or contact the staff member ahead of time and let them know of a possible conflict.  </p>


<h3>How do I know if I have an appointment scheduled for me during FLEX?  </h3>
<p>Students must regularly check the FLEX Time Web App at located in the student ID portal or at <a href="https://tutorial-paly.pausd.org/student.">https://tutorial-paly.pausd.org/student</a>.</p>


<h3>Will I get a grade for FLEX?  
</h3>
<p>No. Students do not receive a separate grade for FLEX. Rather, FLEX provides an opportunity for students to receive additional support and increase their learning, thus improving academically in all of their classes.</p>


<h3>Why is FLEX different this year? Can we go back to how we used to take attendance?</h3>
<p>In order to meet the minimum requirements for instructional minutes in the school year, we needed to add a second FLEX period (Thursdays) to our schedule (remember, the <a href="https://paly.net/bell-schedule-review-committee">Paly Bell Schedule Review Committee</a> developed our current interim schedule last spring). In order to count FLEX minutes, attendance must be taken for all students which means students must remain on campus during the period.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, our old system for taking attendance was problematic for a number of reasons, and therefore we needed to come up with a new process. Last year, you may recall attendance was taken at the end of the period. Despite being told to remain on campus, many students found ways to leave and then come back towards the end of FLEX for attendance taking only. This created big liability problems for our teachers. In addition, we heard many students complain that they didn’t like the interruption at the end of FLEX which required they travel to their assigned FLEX teacher just for attendance taking (especially if they were in the middle of taking a test, a lab or other engaging activity). By taking attendance at the beginning of the period and requiring students to remain in one place, we solve some of these issues. This expectation for FLEX time and the new attendance system are also the same at Gunn High School, which nicely aligns our two high schools. Gunn has been using this system for the past two years.

<h2>How to best use FLEX time</h2>

<h3>What should I do if I don’t need help with anything? 
</h3>
<p>FLEX can be used for more than just review and make-­ups. Students can use FLEX to study for tests; meet with counselors; visit the wellness center; apply to jobs, colleges, or community service opportunities; attend info sessions by college counselors, and much more. Consider this roadmap.  </p>


<h3>Can I work on a group project during FLEX? And does my whole group have to sign-­up for the same location?  </h3>
<p>Yes, you can work on group projects in a classroom (with the teacher’s permission), in the MAC, the library, and other open resource centers around campus. Be sure that all group members sign-­up for the same location to ensure there is enough space for all of you.  </p>

<h3>Can clubs meet during FLEX?     
</h3>
<p>No. FLEX is considered an academic class period which restricts clubs from meeting during this time.    </p>

<h2>FLEX Locations</h2>

<h3>Can I go to more than one classroom on the same day?  
</h3>
<p>No. While you may work on tasks for another class, in order for the attendance system to work during FLEX, students must remain in the same place the entire time. We are hopeful this may change over time as the software improves based on our user feedback.   </p>

<h3>Can I sign‐up for PE classes during FLEX?  
</h3>
<p>Yes. PE make-up sessions are held in the stadium. FLEX is also a time for open gym in the new Peery Center. Students can report to the small gym or the fitness center/weight room.</p>

<h3>Can I work in a teacher’s classroom if I don’t have that teacher for a class?  </h3>
<p>In general, students should be in the classroom of one of their teachers. Special   circumstances may allow a student to visit a teacher they don’t have this year, but this should not be the norm.   </p>        

<h3>What if I don’t have any work to do and just want to “kick back?”</h3>
<p>We have tried to design a system that gives maximum flexibility for students to make good choices and create balance in their lives. Students should speak with their teachers, teacher advisor and/or family to brainstorm how to best use this time. Students can always bring a book and read quietly. Over the course of the semester, we hope to offer additional learning opportunities to students based on their feedback and interests. Stay tuned for details!                                                                 </p>

<h3>What do I do if I don’t need extra help with academics, but want to get some work done in a quiet space?</h3>                                
<p>The MAC Library has been designated a “Silent Study Room” and “quiet time” is also in effect in the temporary Library (Student Center) during FLEX. Students may also go to a resource center to work quietly. The resource centers are in the 800 building (Math and History/Social Science), 1700 building (Science), and the World Language computer lab (rm. 410).</h3>

<h2>Making Appointments</h2>

<h3>What if I forget to sign‐up for an appointment in advance?</h3>
<p>The best way to ensure you get to go where you want to during FLEX is to sign up ahead of time (Go To: https://tutorial-paly.pausd.org/student). If you forget to sign up, you will need to quickly find a place to work before passing time ends.</p>

<h3>Can I change an appointment after I have created it?</h3>
<p>Yes, but you should notify your teacher to alert him/her of the change. To edit the  appointment, simply make a new appointment for the same day and the new appointment will replace the old one.  </p>

<h3>Will the website (https://tutorial-paly.pausd.org/student) work on my phone?</h3>
<p>Yes. The site can be accessed using any web browser on a mobile device.  </p>

<h3>My teacher signed me up for her class, but I really need to go somewhere else.  What should I do?  </h3>
<p>Talk to the teacher who made the appointment. Teachers want to make FLEX work for you. We will do our best to help you share your time across all your different classes.  </p>

<h3>What if I need to see a counselor but only for a short visit?</h3>
<p>Visit the counselor and then find a place to go for the remainder of the FLEX period. You will get a pass.</p>

<h3>What if I’m returning from an absence and need to see more than one teacher?</h3>
<p>We’re working on a pass system to help address this need. Stay tuned for details. For now, please report to just one teacher.</p>


<h3>Who can I speak to about a special circumstance or if I have a specific question regarding FLEX?</h3>
<p>Students can come talk to Assistant Principals Dr. Janice Chen or Mr. Adam Paulson. Parents can send an email to jachen@pausd.org or apaulson@pausd.org</p>
