<h1>About</h1>

<h3>What is paly.win?</h3>
<p>This is a strealined version of the bloated <a href="https://paly.net">Paly website</a> site. It loads <i>much</i> faster and only includes links which are used on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>Why is paly.win necessary?</h3>
<p>paly.net is (1) slow to load, (2) not mobile-friendly, and (3) difficult to navigate. Paly.win fixes all of these problems. It's not intended to be a replacement for paly.net, but simply a place to access the school calendar and frequently-used links.</p>

<h3>Why the name paly.win?</h3>
<p>It's short and easy to remember.</p>

<h3>Why is there no loading animation between pages?</h3>
<p>Paly.win makes use of <a href="http://barbajs.org/">barba.js</a>, a lightweight JS library for making transitions between pages faster and smoother. This helps make paly.win as fast as possible.</p>

<h3>Who made this site?</h3>
<p>paly.win was made by <a href="https://oliviachang.me" target="_blank">Olivia Chang</a>.</p>
