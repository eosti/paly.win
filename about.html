<h3>What is paly.win?</h3>
<p>This is a strealined version of the bloated <a href="https://paly.net">Paly website</a>. It loads <i>much</i> faster and only includes links which are used on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>Why is paly.win necessary?</h3>
<p>paly.net is (1) slow to load, (2) not mobile-friendly, and (3) difficult to navigate. paly.win fixes all of these problems. It's not intended to be a replacement for paly.net, but simply the site that you use regularly.</p>

<h3>Why the name paly.win?</h3>
<p>It's short, easy to remember, and hopefully evokes positive emotions.</p>

<h3>Why the lack of custom fonts?</h3>
<p>Sadly, custom fonts slow down sites considerably. In the effort to make paly.win as fast as possible, I decided against custom fonts and instead employed system fonts (my deepest apologies if you continue to use Internet Explorer).</p>

<h3>Why is there no loading animation between pages?</h3>
<p>paly.win makes use of <a href="http://barbajs.org/">barba.js</a>, a lightweight JS library for making transitions between pages faster and smoother. This makes paly.win as fast as possible.</p>

<h3>I'm good at coding. Can I contribute?</h3>
<p>Sure. <a href="https://github.com/oliviachang29/paly.win" target="_blank">I await your pull request.</a></p>
