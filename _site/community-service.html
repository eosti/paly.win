<h3>How do I log community service?</h3>
<p>
	Paly uses HelperHelper <a href="https://app.helperhelper.com">HelperHelper.com</a> to log hours of community service. You can download the app or use the website.
	<ul>
		<li>Login using school email address (username).</li>

	</ul>
	Submission periods for the President’s Service Volunteer Award requests are accepted twice per year, once in the fall semester and again in the spring semester.  These submission periods will be announced via Schoology.
	The only graduation requirements for community service are the hours completed through Living Skills. There are other classes that may assign community service as part of their coursework.
	Volunteer hours earned by a student after promotion from the day after 8th grade promotion until the fall of senior year will be reported on a student’s transcript.
